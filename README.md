See the following paper for the detail.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08539

1. 'fs_ols' is the proposed feature selection method
2. 'fs_ols_d' is the proposed feature selection method for matrix form features. Each feature should be enclosed in a cell.
3. 'fs_cca' is feature selection method based on the cca defination
4. 'fs_lda' is feature selection method based on the lda defination
